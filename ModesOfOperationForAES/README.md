[Programming Assignment #1](https://piazza-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/ixp1n5argll6bp/iyp83k9edi11h1/prog1.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIEDNRLJ4AZKBW6HA&Expires=1486683387&Signature=kRutt%2FswaAs4rjh5cRnXCYZCy0I%3D) - Problem 1

All the codes are self-documented or have further comments beside. 

##Requirements
- Python 3.6.0
- Pycrypto 2.6.1

##Solution
I implemented the encryption/decryption of CBC mode and CTR mode using the block encryption/decryption methods in the libruary, and used them to check if the result accord with the result from the libruary.
